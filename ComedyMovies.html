<h2>The Internship</h2>


<p>This movie is absolutely hilarious!! This movie was realeased in 2013, directed by Shawn Levy, and stars Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. These two men have just been informed that their company has shut down. they are both ravenous to find jobs, when Billy, Vince Vaughn, finds an interview for an internship at Google. These two middle aged men know almost nothing about technology, and their knowledge is put to the test for this rigorus internship, filled with pranks, quitich, math and coding, teamwork, and lots of laughs. This movie never fails to make me smile and give me second hand embarrasment! </p>
