<p>Another movie genre I love is movies that make you think or that have deeper messages to them. Down below you will see some of my favorites!</p>



<h2>Beautiful Girls</h2>

<p>Beautiful Girls is my second all time favorite movie. Released in 1996, director Ted Demme does a great job showcasing the struggles of just trying to make it through your 20s and 30s and the facts of having an early mid-life crisis. Willie (Timothy Hutton), moved to New York City to persure his dream of playing piano, yet is getting little pay, and the same "sad" gigs, as he likes to call it. He goes home for his high school reunion to meet up with some of his buddies (Matt Dillon, Michael Rapaport, Rosie O'Donell, Noah Emmerich) from that time of his life, and realized how much nothing has really changed there. The popular kid in high school is still lost in his glory days, one has already settled down and had kids, one is struggling with his relationship, and Willie is stuck between to loves, and even meets his new neighbor, a 13 year old girl, (natalie Portman), the bartenders cool cousin (Uma Thurman) and has some of the biggest realizations of his life.</p>

<h2>Garden State</h2>


<p>This is a great movie staring Natalie portman and Zach Braff, also directed by Zach Braff in 2004. Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) is an aspiring actor in LA when gets a phone call from his father that he hasn't talkled too in years saying his mother has died. He gets on the first flight back to his home town of  Orange, New Jersey and reunites with old friends, falls in love and has some major realzations about life through this deep/slightly morbid story.</p>
